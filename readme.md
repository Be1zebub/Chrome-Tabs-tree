Since this is a pet project that i made in a few hours for personal needs, i do not plan to publish it on the chromewebstore in the near future.  
But if the project gets community, i will do it.

## Other browsers?

I dont plan to do this on my side because i use only chrome  
But feel free to pr, i will push it in new branches.  

How todo?

1. Edit the manifest a little
2. Replace chrome.tabs & chrome.tabGroups with your browser api

## Plans

1. fix favicon display for localhost tabs
2. add loading circle display while tab loading
3. rewrite in svelte
